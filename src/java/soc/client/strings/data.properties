# Reminders about .properties filenames and format:
# - For a locale, the filename is bundlename_lang.properties or (more specific) bundlename_lang_COUNTRY.properties,
#    where lang and country are 2 or 3 characters each.  Keys not found there must be in bundlename.properties.
# - Logically related keys are grouped together in the files, with blank lines separating the groups.
#    Keys within a group might be alphabetical or chronological (based on usual game play).  The groups are ordered
#    in the file with common groups first, then mostly chronologically, then rarely used groups near the end of the file.  
# - Key names are case-sensitive; jsettlers uses mostly-lowercase alphanumeric keys, and "." to organize keys into hierarchies.
# - Parsing a key = value pair, the whitespace around "=" is stripped, but a value's trailing whitespace is kept.  If a
#    value begins with whitespace, use backslash to escape that.  For more info see the java.util.Properties.load javadoc.
#    Best practice in jsettlers is to not use leading or trailing whitespace unless unavoidable, and always comment the
#    reason in the java code and above the properties key-value pair.
# - The encoding must be ISO-8859-1, not UTF-8; see the java.util.Properties javadoc for details.
#    Backslashes must be doubled.  Tab, newline and carriage return are encoded as in Java strings (backslash-t, backslash-n, etc)
#
# Reminders about the format used for text with arguments by SOCStringManager.get and MessageFormat.format:
# - Single-quote characters must be doubled: ''  Left curly brackets must be single-quoted: '{'
# - Message argument numbers start at 0: It''s {0}''s turn to roll the dice.
# - Message arguments can have a format type: {0} rolled a {1,number}.  See java.text.MessageFormat javadoc.
# - JSettlers has special types parsed by SOCStringManager.getSpecial, see its javadoc: {0,list}, {0,rsrcs}, etc
